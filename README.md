# CgigC

Simple Python Request and Response classes that *wrap* the *cgi* module
(hence the name, haha... ehm... :P ) and possibly others as needed, useful for
applications that have to be necessarily\* deployed on third-party, CGI-only
Linux servers.

\* Sometimes\*\* it can be pointless to try to convince the owner of a 10-page,
90%-static website to migrate to a WSGI server...

\*\* Always
